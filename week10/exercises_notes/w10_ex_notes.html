            <li>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away.</li>
            <li>Client-side validation is put into either the HTML itself or in the JavaScript. With HTML the validation is built in with the form tag and with JavaScript you use the Constraint Validation API.</li>
            <li>In HTML it is built into the form element where you can use attributes to tell the form to require a input in a input, make the input a certain length, or have the input have a certain pattern. In JavaScript you can use the Constraint Validation API, which will give you access to different methods that can do the same thing in HTML, but are a lot more customizable.</li>
            <li>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</li>
            <li>How do you use Fetch API? To use the Fetch API, you use the fetch method along with the JSON source path, but this does not grab the JSON content. In order to get the content of the JSON you use the .json() method.</li>
            <li>Why do we use Fecth API? Fetch provides a better way that can be used by other technologies. It also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts.</li>
