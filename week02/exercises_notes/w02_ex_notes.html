            <li>Local scope variables can only be used in the function or block it is contained in. Global scope variables can be used in any part of the code. However, it is best practice to use local scope because you do not want there to be conflicts with variables of the same name.</li>
            <li>Arrays can be used whenever you need a list of objects. These can be multi-dimensional as well.</li>
            <li>Sets are used when you need a list of objects, but do not want duplicates in that list.</li>
            <li>Maps are used when you need to have a key value pair for your list. This makes maps more customizable and also tro search through them using the key or value.</li>
