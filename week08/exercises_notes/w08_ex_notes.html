            <li>The CSS transform propetry lets change the appearence of any element on a page.</li>
            <li>This is accomplished by using transforming functions that allow the user to give elements some pizzazz.</li>
            <li>There are 4 different types of transforming functions which are: translate, scale, rotate, and skew.</li>
            <li>Transition the vvalues of the CSS properties to change over time producing simple animations.</li>
            <li>You must first declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
            <li>Second you have to declare the final state of the transitioned element.</li>
            <li>Lastly you have to include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties.</li>
            <li>The properties are transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.</li>
            <li>CSS animations allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes, which gives them more flexibility over a transition.</li>
            <li>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element&#39;s property declaration block.</li>
            <li>Animations in themselves don&#39;t do anything; in order to animate an element, you&#39;ll need to associate the animation with that element.</li>
            <li>To create an animation yoiu will need to use the @keyframes rule and each keyframe should have its own nested declaration block.</li>
            <li>The animation properties are animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-delay, animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state.</li>
            <li>Canvas allows the user to draw anything through JavaScript onto the HTML page.</li>
            <li>You create a canvas element: &lt;canvas&gt;Sorry the browser does not support Canvas!&lt;/canvas&gt; it will only display the text if canvas is not supported in the browser.</li>
            <li>All drawing on the canvas happens through the Canvas JavaScript API.</li>
            <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and they are a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML.</li>
            <li>You can draw a vector graphic by creating a svg drawing board like so: &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</li>
            <li>The Drag and Drop API allows for certain elements to be draggable, and then specify what should happen when these elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</li>
            <li>First you must set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you'd like to be draggable.</li>
            <li>Next add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML element.</li>
            <li>Lastly, add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements you want to have accept dropped items.</li>
