            <li>Function properties and methods are a lot like Object properties and methods. One of the most common function properties is the length property: myFunction.length can be used to determine the length of the function. Methods such as call() and apply() are used to set the value of "this" inside of a function to an object that is provided as the first argument. The apply() method works the same way except the arguments are provided as an array.</li>
            <li>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. Callbacks are created to be invoked when an event happens. This allows the code to run ourt of order or asynchronously.</li>
            <li>A closure is a reference to a variable used within a function to keep a variable alive to be used in another part of the program. This "inner" function, which is declared inside another function, has full access to all variables declared inside of the scope of the function in which it's declared.</li>
            <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This makes it possible to load data without refreshing the page every time you need to get new or more information.</li>
            <li>AJAX is used to fetch information from websites and API's in the background of a web page or program without causing any refreshes or latency in the program. It accomplishes this by getting the information in the background.</li>
            <li>AJAX through the fecth method allows JavaScript to retrieve information from an online database and return that information in a JSON format.</li>
